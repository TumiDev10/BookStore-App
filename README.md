# BookStore-App

This is a .Net Application.

1. Created an SQL database with Code first Entity Framework (EF). (Code first means you will not be creating the SQL statements on your own, but it will be done for you automagically ðŸ˜‰)

2. Created a RESTful Application Programmable Interface (API)
APIâ€™s allow you to interface with your application via HTTP requests

3. Created a front end using Model View Controller (MVC).
MVC is a pattern â€“ 
I used some HTML. This allows the application to be rendered on the browser
i also used jQuery which is a javascript library. 

This exercise will also teach you Domain Driven Design.

I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL.
